# Winux - Linux Terminal for Windows

The Winux repository is a Python-based project that aims to bring the power of a Linux terminal to Windows users. With Winux, you can enjoy a familiar Linux command-line interface right on your Windows machine, making it easier to work with various development tools, scripts, and commands.

## Installation

To use Winux, you have two options:

1. **Download the Uncompiled Version from Source:**
   - Clone or download the repository and navigate to the `src` folder.
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python modules by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Download the Compiled Executable:**
   - Go to the Releases section of the repository.
   - Download the pre-compiled executable (exe) file.
   - The executable is ready to run without the need for Python or any additional dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have Winux installed, simply launch the exe/py file to access the Linux-like command-line environment. You can now use a wide range of Linux commands and tools right on your Windows operating system. Feel free to explore and enjoy the convenience of a Linux terminal without leaving Windows behind.

Please note that while Winux brings Linux-like functionality to Windows, it may have some limitations or differences from a full Linux distribution.
Happy coding with Winux! ðŸš€
